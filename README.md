# Code Doodling Workshop
## Aim 1
To create some code that looks as if it's doodling, by using the js canvas.

## Aim 2
To experiment and `doodle` with the code. Instead of writing code to meet a specific goal you could instead experiment with and tweak your code and see where it leads you.

## Info
You can try and meet both aims or just one - it's up to you. The main goal is to just have *__fun__*.
I have included a starting point for everyone - you can use it or start from scratch. The javascript includes two functions - one which will draw a point and one which will draw a circle. Feel free to ask me if you don't understand how part of the code works.

## Challenges
If you're stuck for ideas, here are a few to help you get started:
+ Instead of having the code doodle a circle - can you get it to doodle a line? Could you get it to doodle a hexagon?
+ Can you get it to begin a doodle when and where you click the canvas?
+ Can you add some colour to your doodle?
+ Could you make the line colour cycle through the rainbow as it draws?
+ Do you know anything about polar coordinates? The code is currently drawing the equation `r = the radius you passed into the function`. Could you adapt the current code to draw different polar equations? e.g. `r = cos(4θ)`
__Hint:__ to convert from a polar equation to a cartesian equation `x = r ∙ cos(θ)` and `y = r ∙ sin(θ)` and the variable r in the code is being used to scale the graph.
